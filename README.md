## Abstract

In this work, we address the problem of 3D object detection from point cloud data in
real time. For autonomous vehicles to work, it is very important for the perception
component to detect the real world objects with both high accuracy and fast
inference. We propose a novel neural network architecture along with the training
and optimization details for detecting 3D objects in point cloud data. We compare
the results with different backbone architectures including the standard ones like
VGG, ResNet, Inception with our backbone. Also we present the optimization and
ablation studies including designing an efficient anchor. We use the Kitti 3D Bird’s
Eye View dataset for benchmarking and validating our results. Our work surpasses
the state of the art in this domain both in terms of average precision and speed
running at > 30 FPS. This makes it a feasible option to be deployed in real time
applications including self driving cars.

## Data:

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d).

Data to download include:

Velodyne point clouds (29 GB): input data to VoxelNet
Training labels of object data set (5 MB): input label to VoxelNet
Camera calibration matrices of object data set (16 MB): for visualization of predictions
Left color images of object data set (12 GB): for visualization of predictions

Split the training set into training and validation set. And rearrange the folders to have the following structure:

```
└── KITTI
       ├── training   <-- training data
       |   ├── image_2
       |   ├── label_2
       |   └── velodyne
       └── validation  <--- evaluation data
       |   ├── image_2
       |   ├── label_2
       |   └── velodyne
       |
       |__ train.txt
       |
       |__ val.txt
       |
       |__ trainval.txt
```
